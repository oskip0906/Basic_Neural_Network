# Overview

A minimalistic and customizable neural network built from scratch using Python and NumPy. 

## 🧠 Features
- **Modular Design**:
  - Organized class structure for network components.
  - Easily extendable to add new layers, activation functions, and loss functions.
  
- **Customizable Components**:
  - Fully connected (dense) layers with adjustable input and output sizes.
  - Multiple activation and loss functions that can be modified.
    
- **Model Engine**
  - An "engine" that trains, evaluates, saves, and loads the neural network.
  - Adjustable learning rates for training (backpropagation).
  - Custom accuracy functions for evaluation.
  
## 💡 Performance
- Trained on the **MNIST dataset**, achieving **95%** accuracy on the testing set with custom hyperparameters.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
